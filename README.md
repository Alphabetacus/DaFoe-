<h1> SQUIDACUS: DaFoe is back! </h1>
<p> <center>  In an enclosed village outside of Nowhere, there was a leader. One man, known as Squidacus, showed his true potential. The village became cursed by a horrible witch, Alphabetacus. This witch feared Squidacus’ powers of true purity and his determination. With her undivine powers, Alphabetacus cloned all the smurfs of Squidacus’ village, creating shadows. The Shadows became evil and began to chase the real men out of the village. Squidacus realized the Shadows would soon overpower the real life unless there was one Shadow to turn. Squidacus went out on a quest to catch his own shadow in hope that it would make all the shadows run away and disappear, therefore saving his village from the evil darkness. Sent by Alphabetacus, Da evil Foe has brought his reign to be the last defender. </center> </p>
